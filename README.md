# Titanic
In this work model i worked with the 'Titanic' dataset which i have uploaded. Take a look into it, it's a pretty interesting datset with a lot of information.
  a)We have used the visualization tools like ggplot2 function for plotting the survival rate with other parameters showing it's liability and the relativeness about how the survival ratio is affected by different factors.
  b)We also see the insights of all the columns, about how the data has been spread out in the datset by applying summary statistics to it.
  c)Have uploaded the the outputs along with the code in the word files, level 3 - Plots & level 5 - Summary statistics.
